# Guess-the-Color
### Introduction

This program is to do the “guess the color” task.  Specifically, given a set of inputs, each consisting of a two-word fragment of a noun phrase, such as “R cat” or “B dog”.  The task is to read a file containing these inputs and output a file that provides you answers–e.g. “red cat” or “brown dog”. In addition, the examples that do not occur in the Brown corpus are cases that a human can accurately guess the correct.  For instance, it might contain “G frog” and expect the answer GREEN.  As a resource for this assignment, I use the Brown corpus and WordNet.

### How to run the application

The program can be run with the command line:

## python3 [yourprogram].py [input-file] [output-file]

and input file would look like

“b ribbon”
“g bottle”

and the output will be like

“blue ribbon”
“green bottle”
